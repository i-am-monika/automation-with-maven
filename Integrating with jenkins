Continuous Integration with Jenkins

# You can integrate Maven automation with Jenkins for continuous integration.

Step 1: Install Jenkins and Plugins

Download Jenkins: Install Jenkins

Install the Maven Integration Plugin: Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Install "Maven Integration Plugin".

Step 2: Set Up Jenkins and Maven

Install Maven: Ensure Maven is installed on your Jenkins server and configure it under Global Tool Configuration.

Configure Jenkins Job:

Create a New Item and select "Freestyle Project".

Under Source Code Management, select Git and provide the PetClinic repository URL.

Step 3: Add Build Steps

In the Build section, add the following Maven goals:

clean install - To clean the workspace and build the project.

test - To execute the test cases.

Step 4: Configure Post-Build Actions

You can archive the generated JAR file or test reports by adding Post-Build Actions:

Select Archive the Artifacts and mention the path to the JAR file (e.g., target/*.jar).

Step 5: Schedule Builds

Set up automated builds using:

Poll SCM: Trigger builds when code changes are pushed to the repository.

Build Periodically: Schedule builds at regular intervals.

Step 6: Verify Jenkins Integration

Push changes to the repository and monitor Jenkins logs to verify the build triggers automatically.

Check the console output in Jenkins to ensure Maven goals (clean, install, test) are executed successfully.
