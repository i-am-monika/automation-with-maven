OVERVIEW: 

This project showcases how to streamline the build, test, and deployment process for a Java application using Apache Maven. By leveraging Mavenâ€™s robust build lifecycle, dependency management, and plugin ecosystem, this project automates repetitive tasks to improve developer productivity and ensure consistent builds. Additionally, the project demonstrates how to integrate Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), making the workflow efficient and reliable.


FEATURES:

Automated Build Lifecycle: Performed tasks like cleaning, compiling, testing, and packaging with a single command.
Dependency Management: Automatically resolved and manageed project dependencies with Maven's Central Repository.
Environment-Specific Profiles: Configure multiple build profiles for different environments (e.g., development, production).
Unit Testing: Integrated JUnit framework to ensure code reliability through automated testing.
CI/CD Integration: Seamlessly integrate with Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
